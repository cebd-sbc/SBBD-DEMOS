# SBBD Demos and Applications

**A summary of SBBD Demos and Applications for the 2004-2022 period.**


The SBBD Demos and Applications Session has been a discussion venue for exchanging experiences and presenting innovative solutions for data management since 2004.
Submissions from researchers, developers, and professionals interested in practical and functional solutions for relevant problems involving data and information management technology are considered for publication.
Published papers are 6-pages long ([SBC template format](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sbc-conferences-template/blbxwjwzdngr)) and include the applications' description, evaluation, and use cases.
Eventually, source and/or binaries were made publicly available under proper licensing, a reproducibility policy that was encouraged and reinforced after the 2020 edition.

In total, 154 demos were published in the venue with more than 200 authors from different institutions throughout 2004-2002.
Although submitted applications are typically prototypes, many have evolved into commercial versions, supporting thousands of registered users.
